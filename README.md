# Belly-Button-Biodiversity

## Purpose
The purpose of this dashboard is to help Roza filter through and display information regarding belly button biodiversity amongst hundreds of volunteers.
We have demographic information and are trying to vizualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. We did this study to help Improbable Beef try and identify a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef. This dashboard will help Roza's volunteers whether the species is found in their navel.
